Let me tell you about Neovim, the way it was presented to me.
</p>

<p>
Neovim: a modernization of the well-loved Vim. Neovim: a powerful, customizable
editor. Neovim: a necessary addition to anyone's workflow who's seeking to
upgrade their productivity. Neovim: the way.
</p>

<p>
So now you've installed Neovim (you built it from the source for the bleeding
edge of functionality) and can't manage to quit the program. Typing
<code>exit</code> doesn't work, so you smash the keyboard and close the window.
</p>

<p>
Your training arc begins. Soon, getting comfortable with the keybindings, you
spew out code while your mouse lays in a far-flung corner of your desk. You've
now risen to meet the challenge: customization.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Many would argue customization brings out the true power in (N)Vim. I would
argue the same. The first, and in my opinion most important, extension regards
LSPs: Langauge Server Protocols.
</p>

<p>
When VS Code was developing its editor, it ran into the same issue holding back
other small editors' potential: it needed to add syntax support for a vast
array of languages before it could gain widespread acceptance. Sure, they could
go the route of "one language at a time," but this doesn't avoid the eventual
need for extensive development.
</p>

<p>
They brought about LSPs: a way to diffuse production costs among a wide array
of collaborators while allowing smaller editors to enter the picture. Creating
a standard interface protocol, they allowed others to code up "language
servers." These servers could then be used with any editor, incentivizing a
community effort to build up these LSPs. Of course, this means NVim now has
language support too.
</p>

<p>
The second significant feature are snippets. These are essentially keybindings
and abbreviations for otherwise long and redundant pieces of text or code. They
integrate well with LSPs: for the most part, LSPs themselves provide a default
set of snippets. Now, what used to be 3 lines is reduced to 4 characters.
</p>

<p>
So, I came all this way for some snippets and LSPs. Was it truly worth it?
</p>

<p>
For LaTeX, my answer is a resounding "yes"; for things like Markdown files, not
so much. LaTeX is known for its "clunkiness" so to speak: it's difficult to hit
the backslash characters which litter the text, and using less-worn characters
strains one's hands. Snippets have shaved off at least two hours worth of work
here. By contrast, Markdown is essentially English: there isn't much fancy work
to be done.
</p>

<p>
Thus, I'd argue that anybody working in code should at least give it a try;
outside of this, there may not be much scope for practicality.
