# Greetings

    I guess I've changed over the years, though you wouldn't know it unless you
    knew me very deeply. This blog is a way to know me deeply without the
    hassle of weaseling your way around my guarded opinions.

    Call me cynical, but I don't see the point in making myself vulnerable to
    someone who's attention span will clock out a third of the way through. So,
    if you've made it this far, I think you're worth my time. So, I'll lay my
    perspective out for you with the hopes my writing might get you thinking,
    even if you don't draw the same conclusions as I.
